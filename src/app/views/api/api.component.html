        <p>
            I chose this api because of it's universality, and I was
            intrigued by the terms and conditions that were included in its use.
            Stipulations around branding and redirection intrigued me, and I felt
            that it was far more useful to have real news in my project than to give
            the user the ability to create or buy fake products just for experience
            with the Stripe API, for example. </p>

            <!-- <img class="floating_logo" src="/assets/img/spotify.png" alt="Powered By NY Times flag"> -->
            I thought about taking a music centered
            approach and using the Spotify API to play specific songs with lyrics relevant
            to the page they were navigating. However, the Spotify API used the user's own Spotify
            credentials in order to play specific songs and I didn't feel I could rely on that
            in this instance.

            <!-- <img class="floating_logo" src="/assets/img/Google Maps Logo - Download Free Vector PNG.png" alt="Powered By NY Times flag"> -->
            I also considered using the Google Maps API to show users nearby
            restaurants, and several more niche APIs but could not convince myself that any of them
            made for an interesting enough user experience.
